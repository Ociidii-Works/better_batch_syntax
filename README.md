### Better Batch Syntax
===================
#### What is it, and why?

This is a replacement for the (currently poor) Batch syntax support in Sublime Text.
It adds syntax highlighting that is currently missing compared to other editors like Notepad++, for example.

Current work:

+ more commands/keywords
+ fixed wrong regular expression for some stock highlighting.
